   * **Search Geofence Get API**
   *
   * **Applies to:** S1 Pricing tier.
   *
   * The Geofence Get API allows you to retrieve the proximity of a coordinate to a
   * geofence that has been uploaded to the Data service. You can use the
   * [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) to upload
   * a geofence or set of fences. See [Geofencing GeoJSON
   * data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/geofence-geojson)
   * for more details on the geofence data format. To query the proximity of a coordinate, you supply the
   * location of the object you are tracking as well
   * as the ID for the fence or set of fences, and the response will contain information about
   * the distance from the outer edge of the geofence. A negative value signifies that the
   * coordinate is inside of the fence while a positive value means that it is outside of the
   * fence.<br><br>This API can be used for a variety of scenarios that include things like asset
   * tracking, fleet management, or setting up alerts for moving objects.
   *
   * The API supports [integration with Event
   * Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/azure-maps-event-grid-integration). The isAsync
   * parameter is used to enable integration with Event Grid (disabled by default).
   * To test this API, you can upload the sample data from Post Geofence API examples(Request Body) via
   * Data Upload API and replace the [udid] from the sample request below with the udid returned by Data
   * Upload API.
   *
   *
   * ### Geofencing InnerError code
   *
   * In geofencing response error contract, `innererror` is  an object containing service specific
   * information about the error. `code` is a property in `innererror` which can map to a specific
   * geofencing error type. The table belows shows the code mapping between all the known client error
   * type to the corresponding geofencing error `message`.
