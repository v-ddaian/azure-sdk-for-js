   * **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).
   *
   * Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure
   * Maps API and SDK. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps) article
   * introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator.
   *
   * This API allows the caller to fetch a list of all successful data conversions submitted previously
   * using the [Conversion
   * API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/conversion/convertpreview).
   *
   * ### Submit List Request
   *
   * To list all successful conversions you will issue a `GET` request with no additional parameters.
   *
   * ### List Data Response
   *
   * The Conversion List API returns the complete list of all conversion details in `json` format.<br>
   *
   * Here is a sample response returning the details of two successful conversion requests:
   *
   * <br>
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "conversions":
   *     [

   * Maps API and SDK. [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps) article

   *
   * The Conversion API lets the caller import a set of DWG design files as a zipped [Drawing
   * Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) into Azure Maps. The [Drawing
   * Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) should first be uploaded using the [Azure Maps Data
   * Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data). Once uploaded, use the `udid` returned by
   * the [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data/uploadpreview) to call this
   * Conversion API.
   *
   * ## Convert DWG package
   *
   * The Conversion API performs a [long-running request](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).
   *
   * ## Debug DWG package issues
   *
   *
   * During the Conversion process, if there are any issues with the DWG package [errors and
   * warnings](https://aka.ms/am-conversion-errors) are provided in the response along with a *diagnostic
   * package* to visualize and diagnose these issues. In case any issues are encountered with your DWG
   * package, the Conversion operation status process as detailed
   * [here](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2) returns the location of the *diagnostic package* that can
   * be downloaded by the caller to help them visualize and diagnose these issues. The *diagnostic
   * package* location can be found in the properties section of the conversion operation status response
   * and looks like the following:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *     "properties": {
   *         "diagnosticPackageLocation":
   * "https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapdata/{DiagnosticPackageId}?api-version=1.0"
   *     }
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * The *diagnostic package* can be downloaded by executing a `HTTP GET` request on the
   * `diagnosticPackageLocation`.
   * For more details on how to use the tool to visualize and diagnose all the errors and warnings see
   * [Drawing Error Visualizer](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-errors-visualizer). <br>
   *
   * A conversion operation will be marked as *success* if there are zero or more warnings but will be
   * marked as *failed* if any errors are encountered.
   * @param udid The unique data id for the content. The `udid` must have been obtained from a successful
   *             [Data Upload API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data%20v2/uploadpreview) call.
   * @param outputOntology Output ontology version. "facility-2.0" is the only supported value at this
   *                       time. Please refer to this
   *                       [article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/creator-facility-ontology) for more
