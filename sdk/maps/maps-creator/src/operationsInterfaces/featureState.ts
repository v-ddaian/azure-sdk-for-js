   * Creator makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure
   * Maps API and SDK. The Feature State API is part of Creator.
   *
   * The Feature State service allows the user to update the states of a feature and query them to be
   * used in other services. The dynamic properties of a feature that don't belong to the dataset are
   * referred to as *states* here.
   *
   * This Feature State service pivot on the Stateset. Like Tileset, Stateset encapsulates the storage
   * mechanism for feature states for a dataset.
   *
   * Once the stateset is created, users can use that statesetId to post feature state updates and
   * retrieve the current feature states. A feature can have only one state at a given point in time.
   *
   * Feature state is defined by the key name, value and the timestamp. When a feature state update is
   * posted to Azure Maps, the state value gets updated only if the provided stateâ€™s timestamp is later
   * than the stored timestamp.
   *
   * Azure Maps MapControl provides a way to use these feature states to style the features. Please refer
   * to the State Tile documentation for more information.
